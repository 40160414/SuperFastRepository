  <h2>This web page has been specifically created for my Cloud Computing Assignment 2. <h2>
  
   <h2> I was planning to use my Action Sports website 
     created in WordPress, but it transpires Azure does not 
     publish existing websites from WordPress.<h2>
     
    <h2> It is possible to create an website from Azure 
      using the Wordpress app service, but the assignment i
      s to publish an existing website.<h2>
      
     <h2> So for expediency sake I have created this website in Github, 
       to complete the assignment.<h2>
